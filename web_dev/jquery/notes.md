#JQUERY ATTACK PLAN

#Check Youtube for short intro tutorials. These are good for beginning.

#Flesh out knowledge with a google search for  "jQuery tutorial" or "Beginning jQuery" These work well after the videos because you can scroll through them and bypass what you've learned in the videos.

#No breaks during research! Don't get out of the zone!

#Test things in JS Fiddle when the concept is unclear or just looks really cool.
