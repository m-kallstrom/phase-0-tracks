#JQUERY ATTACK PLAN

#Check Youtube for short intro tutorials. These are good for beginning.

#Flesh out knowledge with a google search for  "jQuery tutorial" or "Beginning jQuery". These work well after the videos because you can scroll through them and bypass what you've learned in the videos.

#Google search for any specific things that have been unclear.

#No breaks during research! Don't get out of the zone!

#Test things in JS Fiddle when the concept is unclear or just looks really cool.



#RESULTS

#Less than impressed with the jQuery tutorials I found on youtube. Maybe I was just impatient. They didn't seem to be linking to a JS page, like we've learned, and wanted to download jQuery rather than linking to it in the HTML document.

#w3schools is useful and easy to understand.

#I stopped to try things out a lot more than I had anticipated. Possibly because jQuery (and even JS) is still quite new to me.

#A lot more Googling of specifics than I anticipated. Possibly because I'm having trouble focusing today.
