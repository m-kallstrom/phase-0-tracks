  <h1>Backyard Beekeeping for Fun and Profit</h1>
    <img src="beeees.jpg">
    <p>One day, I finished reading <em>The Secret Life of Bees</em> and I decided to be a beekeeper. While there is a lot of learning involved, you too can learn this fun and educational (not to mention delicious!) hobby. All you need is some money, a little time, and a lack of fear about new experiences that might be somewhat painful. </p>
  <h2>Necessary Gear</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bees</li>
      <li>Somewhere to put them</li>
      <li>Flowers, within a 4 mile radius, preferably organic</li>
      <li>Bee suit, or highly puncture resistant skin</li>
      <li>A smoker, preferably <a href="https://www.betterbee.com/smokers-and-fuel/SMOKESTANDARD1.asp">the device</a> but a chain smoker might work fine, too</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Inspecting a Hive</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Put on protective gear (unless you are Luke Cage).</li>
      <li>Light fire in smoker. <strong>Do not light self, house, pets, or car on fire.</strong></li>
      <li>Gently smoke bee hive. Or have your chain smoker smoke a few while standing next to it.</li>
      <li>Open hive. Retreat if bees seem unusually pissed. Unfortunately, you will have to get stung a few times to figure out what is usual and what is not.</li>
      <li>Go through the frames of the hive, looking for solid brood pattern, sufficient stores of pollen and honey, and any signs of pests or disease.</li>
      <li>Look for the Queen. The bee breeder will often put a colored dot on her back to make her easier to spot.</li>
      <li>If everything looks good, close up the hive, put out your smoker, and take off bee suit <strong>after checking for bees on it.</strong></li>
      <li>If all does not look well, follow above steps with gloomy resolution and head straight for the appropriate internet forums.</li>
    </ol>
