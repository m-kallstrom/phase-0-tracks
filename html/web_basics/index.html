  <h1>Backyard Beekeeping for Fun and Profit</h1>
    <img src="beeees.jpg" alt="The author, hanging with some bees.">
    <p>One day, I finished reading <em>The Secret Life of Bees</em> and I decided to be a beekeeper. While there is a lot of learning involved, you too can learn this fun and educational (not to mention delicious!) hobby. All you need is some money, a little time, and a lack of fear about new experiences that might be somewhat painful. </p>
  <h2>Necessary Gear</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Bees</li>
      <li>Somewhere to put them</li>
      <li>Flowers, within a 4 mile radius, preferably organic</li>
      <li>Bee suit, or highly puncture resistant skin</li>
      <li>A smoker, preferably <a href="https://www.betterbee.com/smokers-and-fuel/SMOKESTANDARD1.asp">the device</a>, but a chain smoker might work fine, too</li>
    </ul>
  <h2>Inspecting a Hive</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Put on protective gear (unless you are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Cage#Powers_and_abilities">Luke Cage</a>).</li>
      <li>Light a fire in the smoker. <strong>Do not light self, house, pets, or car on fire.</strong></li>
      <li>Gently smoke your bee hive. Or have your chain smoker smoke a few minutes while standing next to it.</li>
      <li>Open hive. Retreat if bees seem unusually irate. Unfortunately, you will have to get stung a few times to figure out what is usual and what is not.</li>
      <li>Go through the frames of the hive, looking for solid brood pattern, sufficient stores of pollen and honey, and any signs of pests or disease.</li>
      <li>Look for the Queen. The bee breeder will often put a colored dot on her back to make her easier to spot.</li>
      <li>If everything looks good, close up the hive, put out your smoker, and take off bee suit <strong>after checking for bees on it.</strong></li>
      <li>If all does not look well, follow above steps with gloomy resolution and head straight for the appropriate internet forums.</li>
    </ol>
  <h2>Deliciousness of Honey, a Comparison:</h2>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th> Substance:
          <th> Delicious?
          <th> Terrible?
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td> Honey
          <td><center>(x)</center>
          <td>
        <tr>
          <td> Tar
          <td>
          <td><center>(x)</center>
        <tr>
          <td> White-Out
          <td>
          <td><center>(x)</center>
        <tr>
          <td> Expired Milk
          <td>
          <td><center>(x)</center>
    </table>
  <p>The above table clearly demonstrates that the deliciousness of honey is far superior to that of other common substances.This alone is great reason for you to invest in your own beehive!
