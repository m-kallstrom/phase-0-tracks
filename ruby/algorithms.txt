In phase-0-tracks/ruby/algorithms.txt, write the algorithm for using an elevator. Remember, robots are not smart at all, so you'll have to spell everything out.

For instance, how will your robot figure out which floor button to press?

Release 1: Find a Real-Life Algorithm
You're a smart human, not a dumb computer. That means you likely follow algorithms on a daily basis without even knowing it, taking your astonishing abilities completely for granted.

DO THE THING
Come up with an example of a common task in your life that could be translated into an algorithm, and write out the steps in algorithms.txt (labeled with the name of the task).

Submit the GitHub URL of your file to complete this challenge.
